__Task 2 : Tic Tac Toe game in Java__

__Description :__ 

A tic tac toe game in Java involves creating a 3x3 grid and allowing two players to take turns placing their respective marks (X or O) on the grid. The player who places three of their marks in a row, column, or diagonal wins the game.

To implement a tic tac toe game in Java, you will need to create a user interface that displays the 3x3 grid and allows the players to interact with it. You can use a GUI framework like Swing or JavaFX to create the user interface.

The game logic involves checking the state of the grid after each player's turn to determine if any player has won the game or if the game is a draw. You can use an array or a 2D array to store the state of the grid and update it after each player's turn.

To determine if a player has won the game, you will need to check if there are three of their marks in a row, column, or diagonal. You can use nested loops to iterate over the rows, columns, and diagonals of the grid and check for matches.

If a player has won the game, the program should display a message indicating the winner and end the game. If the game is a draw, the program should display a message indicating the draw and end the game.

Overall, a tic tac toe game in Java involves creating a user interface, implementing the game logic, and handling user input. It requires knowledge of Java programming, GUI frameworks, and game development.
